# RPI3
# DRIVERS FOR RPI3
# Since you are trying to install the windows 10 without having the correct drivers(perhaps).
Please check your RPi3  If it has BCM2837 than perhaps you may see the second chipset near to that "SMSC LAN 9514-JZX"
This one uses the drivers I have uploaded here.

Please refer the correct one for your need ( I am uploading both x86 /x 64) for Windows 8.1 since the windows 10 drivers are not comlied for this chipset.
I assume that for x86 may be compatible for you reaserch,I am not sure I need to buy one , Which I dont budget it now.
This one can sole your problem for both USB as well Networking.
Please share your feedback.
